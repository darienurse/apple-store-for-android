# Apple Store for Android
Apple Store for Android is a mobile app the streams information from [Itunes’s RSS Feed] and displays them on an android device. These feeds automatically update to reflect iTunes' top charts and new content, so this app will always be up to date with the latest in the iTunes Store.The app currently shows top 200 items from six categories:
- Top Grossing Mobile Applications
- Top Grossing Mac Applications
- Top Albums
- Top TV Seasons
- Top Books
- Top Podcasts

###Version

###Known Issues
-	The application may lag such the interface temporarily freezes.
-	Sometimes content may not display on screen. I believe this may be a result of how information is stored between activities.

###Acknowledgments
